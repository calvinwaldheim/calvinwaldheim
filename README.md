### 👋 Hi, I'm Calvin — Product-Driven Builder with a Bias for Action

I'm a Product Manager, solo builder, and 2x startup founder with 8+ years of experience turning ideas into scalable products across startups, scale-ups, and corporate innovation labs.

I specialize in:

* 🧠 **AI & LLM Integration** – Building tools with Cursor, v0, and low-code platforms to prototype and ship fast  
* 🛠️ **0→2 Product Development** – From concept to launch in B2B, industrial IoT, and enterprise SaaS  
* 🌐 **Innovation Strategy** – Developed global frameworks at ERIKS to bring corporate innovation to life  
* 🧹 **Cross-functional Leadership** – Aligning engineering, design, and business in complex environments

### 🔭 What I'm working on now:

**PinPoint** – an AI-powered whiteboard for product and engineering teams. It connects brainstorming, prompt design, and task handoff into one flow. PinPoint turns structured prompts into executable plans, acting as a visual IDE for PMs.
